# IntroToDataScience

Welcome to **IntroToDataScience**! This repository is a collection of resources, examples, and projects designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of data science. Whether you're just getting started or looking to refresh your skills, you'll find tutorials, code examples, and hands-on projects to help you learn and apply data science techniques.

## Contents

- **Data Science Fundamentals**  
  An introduction to key data science concepts, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

- **Python Programming for Data Science**  
  Scripts and Jupyter notebooks that cover Python basics and the use of essential libraries such as:
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
  - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

- **Machine Learning**  
  Introductory projects demonstrating various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

- **Projects and Case Studies**  
  Hands-on projects that allow you to apply the concepts learned to real-world datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the examples and projects in this repository, you should have:
- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) for running interactive notebooks

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gregorymurad/IntroToDataScience.git
   cd IntroToDataScience
Install the required Python libraries:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Then install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
Recommended IDE: PyCharm

I personally use PyCharm for Python development and highly recommend it. PyCharm offers powerful tools for debugging, code analysis, and seamless Git integration, which can make your data science workflow even smoother.

Usage
Learning: Follow along with the notebooks to understand data science workflows, practice coding examples, and work on exercises.
Projects: Experiment with the projects provided to gain hands-on experience with data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
Experimentation: Modify the code, try new datasets, or integrate additional libraries to further your learning.
